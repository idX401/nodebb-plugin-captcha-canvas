# nodebb-plugin-captcha-canvas

    npm i git+https://github.com/idX401/nodebb-plugin-captcha-canvas

This plugin adds a captcha to the registration process for new users to solve. It displays a text instruction that the user has to enter in an input box.

This is probably not the most appropriate captcha for frequently visited websites. In most cases, reCAPTCHA, recaptcha, geetest and others will be the best choice. You may want to consider using other captcha verification solutions, such as [`nodebb-plugin-spam-be-gone`](https://www.nomos.com/package/nodebb-plugin-spam-be-gone ).

If the `nodebb-plugin-prometheus` plugin is installed and activated, this plugin will deliver additional metrics.
